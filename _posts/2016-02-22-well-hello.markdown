I have wanted to start a blog for some time now, but have always found excuses not
to. I have put my foot down, and put atleast a little effort into it now. One of the
big factors to me starting this was how easy it was to setup up using GitHub Pages.
So I a found a theme that I liked (Thanks to [Josh Gerdes][joshgerdes] for the
[theme][unotheme]) and well here I am now. 

Not sure what I will be posting about, but I have a few ideas of some tutorials I
might do. One in specific will be on setting up the Juniper JNC client on Fedora
Linux (Didn't find any documentation for Fedora, only Ubuntu). Let me know if there
is anything you want to see, and I will do my best to create something for it.

I don't have any link on here at the time of posting for my [Keybase][keybase] account,
but go ahead and track me on there!
